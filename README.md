# String-Program

## About

This program is about basic feautures of Java 7. It was originally developed on Netbeans and VSCode with jdk-16.0.1. Now it's available for download [HERE](https://memesggopoop28.github.io/stringprogram). It might say that the file is harmful. That is because I haven't finished it.
